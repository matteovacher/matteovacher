## Hi, I'm Matteo and I am a Master's Student at ISAE-SUPAERO in Toulouse, France.  

- **Education :** I went through a Classe préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles at Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris and now I for the end of my cursus (last year) I want to study in the field of informatic (data and decision science course at ISAE-SUPAERO). 

- **Reasearch and international Experience :** In May, I'll be an exchange research student at Center for Artificial Intelligence at the Univerty of Tsukuba, Japan. I'll be studying soft-robots and unsing evolutionary computing to optimize their morphological design and controller. 

- **Interests :** Evolutionary computing (explore bio-inspired solutions to problems), Machine Learning (building models to extract insights from complex data), Social insects (I am a big fan of ants and how they interact with their environment)
